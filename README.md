3. To all the Indian students interested in working on research projects, there is an amazing opportunity at NTU-Singapore (One of the best universities      for Research in Asia) for all of you pursuing B-Tech/M-tech. The university has got a huge pool of professors in all the Engineering and Scientific        domains and you are free to choose your research preferences while you apply.

   Requirements: A decent GPA/CGPA score, 2 LORs, and an updated Resume.

   The applications for the summer term of 2022 have started today and will be open up to 31st December 2021. I would recommend everyone to apply for this    even if you haven't got a chance to work on any research project in the past, as this would certainly be the first great opportunity to get started.
